## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- See relevant user information based on their search
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

### What I learned

hello everyone ;) with this challenge I continued the practice regarding the use of **API**, I had some small problems managing some of the data shown on the screen, but nothing complicated. Overall I think everything went very well ;)

### Continued development

I will continue to create challenges of this type, regarding data management through APIs, and at the same time I will continue with other types of challenges that have a good level of training regarding the use of **JS**.
